## SEIZING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

In the dynamic landscape of the technological industry, several key trends are shaping the future and presenting new opportunities for us to capitalise on.

## CLOUD COMPUTING

Cloud computing is experiencing remarkable transformations. Organizations are embracing hybrid and multi-cloud environments that combine public and private clouds, moving away from one-side-fts-all solutions. However, navigating the complexities of multi-cloud environments poses challenges to adoption, prompting the need for solutions that genuinely streamline management. At the same time, serverless computing continues to gain traction, marked by its cost-efficiency, scalability, and focus on application logic without server infrastructure management. Gartner forecasts spending on public cloud services to grow by 20.4\% to USD 678.8 Billion in 2024 from USD 563.6 Billion in 2023.

## THE PATH OF ADAPTIVE AI IN DIVERSE SECTORS

In the ever-evolving intersection of business and technology, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has become a transformative force. The concept of adaptive AI offers unprecedented capabilities to navigate complexities. Unlike static AI models, adaptive AI possesses the agility and flexibility to continually enhance its performance, adapt to dynamic conditions, and furnish actionable insights in real time. Furthermore, the versatility of adaptive AI transcends industry boundaries, finding applications across diverse sectors such as finance, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and more. As adaptive AI continues to evolve and proliferate, it promises to reshape industries and redefine business agility on a global scale.

To The Members of LITMindtree Limited (Formerly known as Larsen \& Toubro Infotech Limited) REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of LITMindtree Limited ("the Parent") and its subsidiaries, (the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as "the Group"), which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year ended on that date, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on the consideration of reports of the other auditors on separate financial statements of the subsidiaries referred to in the Other Matters section below, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act, ("ind AS") and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2024, and their consolidated profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their consolidated changes in equity and their consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing ("SAc") specified under section 143 (10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ("ICAI") together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the sub-paragraphs (a) of the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

| No. | Key Audit Matter | Auditor's Response |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 1. | Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method | Principal audit procedures performed: <br> Our audit procedures included the following, among others: |
|  | Revenue limit: Fixed price contracts including software development and system integration contracts is recognized using a percentage of completion method. Use of the percentage-ofcompletion method requires the Group to determine the actual costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total costs to be incurred. Costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. | - We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to <br> (1) recording of costs incurred and estimation of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and <br> (2) access and application controls pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorized changes to recording of efforts incurred. |
|  | We identified revenue recognition of fixed price contracts where the percentage of completion is used as a Key Audit Matter once.- <br> - High inherent risk around accuracy of revenue, given the customized and complex nature of these contracts. <br> - High inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, costs incurred to-date and estimates of costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the term of the contract. | - We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured using the percentage-of-completion method and performed the following: <br> - Read the contract and based on the terms and conditions evaluated whether recognizing revenue over time using percentage of completion method was appropriate, and the contract was included in management's calculation of revenue over time. |

## No. Key Audit Matter

A) year-end, significant amount of work in progress (unfolded revenue), related to these contracts is recognised on the balance sheet.

This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue and unbifed revenue recognized on these fixed-price contracts. Refer Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.

## Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon

- The Parent's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board's Report including Annexures to Board's Report, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder's Information, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.
- Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
- In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, compare with the financial statements of the subsidiaries audited by the other auditors, to the extent it relates to these entities and, in doing so, place reliance on the work of the other auditors and consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. Other information so far as it relates to the subsidiaries, is traced from their financial statements audited by the other auditors.
- If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.


## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Parent's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Parent, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intend to liquidate their respective entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group.# Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Parent has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosure in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by the other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Parent and such other entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Other Matters

(a) We did not audit the financial statements of 11 subsidiaries, whose financial statements reflect total assets of ₹ 19,301 million as at March 31, 2024, total revenues of ₹ 24,663 million and net cash outflows amounting to ₹ 171 million for the year ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements. These financial statements have been audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by the Management and our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries, and our report in terms of subsection (3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.

## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITY

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Parent's internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

## MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

## INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
