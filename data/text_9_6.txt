During this year, LTMindtree built Gen AI-driven cloud-based solution Leaptrop that allows insurers to drive continuous product innovation, provide differentiated customer experiences and empower intelligent Insurance. Built in partnership with Duck Creek and Microsoft, LTMindtree is enabling insurers to migrate their on-premises core systems to the cloud quicker and easier. It is also working with new products such as Duck Creek Clarity to help carriers become better data-driven businesses as they reimagine the future of insurance.
