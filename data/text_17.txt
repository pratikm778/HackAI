## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period.

## No. Key Audit Matter

AQ. Key Audit Matter Auditor's Response

- At year-end, significant amount of work in progress (unfolded revenue), related to these contracts is recognised on the balance sheet.
This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue and unbifed revenue recognized on these fixed-price contracts. Refer Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.

Compared costs incurred with Company's estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant variations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs or efforts to complete the contract.

- Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off from customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts to complete the remaining performance obligations.
