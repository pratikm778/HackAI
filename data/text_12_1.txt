IV. EMPLOYEES All employees at LTIMindtree are classified as either Permanent or Other than Permanent, with no categorization as 'Workers'. Recognizing that gender is not strictly binary, some individuals may prefer to opt out of traditional male/female identification and select 'Others'. This inclusive category encompasses individuals who identify as non-binary, gender-fluid, transgender, or any other gender identity beyond the binary norm. In the fiscal year 2023-24, 231 of our employees identified their gender as 'Others' within our talent pool. In this BRSR report, we have included data on the 'Other' gender category alongside the conventional male/female categorization, wherever applicable and data available. 20.
