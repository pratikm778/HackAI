CLOUD COMPUTING Cloud computing is experiencing remarkable transformations. Organizations are embracing hybrid and multi-cloud environments that combine public and private clouds, moving away from one-size-fits-all solutions. However, navigating the complexities of multi-cloud environments poses challenges to adoption, prompting the need for solutions that genuinely streamline management. At the same time, serverless computing continues to gain traction, marked by its cost-efficiency, scalability, and focus on application logic without server infrastructure management. Gartner forecasts spending on public cloud services to grow by 20.4% to USD 678.8 Billion in 2024 from USD 563.6 Billion in 2023.
