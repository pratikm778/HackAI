## No. Key Audit Matter

- At year-end, significant amount of work in progress (unfolded revenue), related to these contracts is recognised on the balance sheet.

This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue and unbifed revenue recognized on these fixed-price contracts. Refer Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.
